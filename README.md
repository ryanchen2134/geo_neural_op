### Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) 

Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) allow for data-driven deep learning of
features from point-cloud representations and other datasets for tasks
involving geometry.   This includes training protocols and learned operators
for estimating local curvatures, evaluating geometric differential operators,
solvers for PDEs on manifolds, mean-curvature shape flows, and other tasks.
The package provides practical neural network architectures and factorizations
for training to accounting for geometric contributions and features.  The
package also has a modular design allowing for use of GNPs within other
data-processing pipelines.  Pretrained models are also provided for estimating
curvatures, Laplace-Beltrami operators, components for PDE solvers, and other
geometric tasks.

**Robust Estimators:** Our pre-trained GNP models and training methods also allow for 
coping with noise and other artifacts that arise when processing point-clouds in practice.
This allows for robust estimates of the curvature and other geometric properties even when 
point-clouds have artifacts, such as outliers as shown below.

**Examples:** We provide practical demonstrations for how GNPs can be used in
practice.  This includes examples (i) to estimate geometric properties, such as
the metric and curvatures of surfaces, (ii) to approximate solutions of
geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to
perform curvature-driven flows of shapes. These results show a few ways GNPs
can be used for incorporating the roles of geometry into machine learning
processing pipelines and solvers.

__Installation__


```bash
git clone git@github.com:atzberg/geo_neural_op.git
conda create -n gnp python=3.12
conda activate gnp
```
Install PyTorch prior to installing the repo to avoid installation errors 
related to torch-cluster and torch-scatter. To install PyTorch with cpu, use:
```bash
pip install torch==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
To install with CUDA, use one of the following, replacing X with the correct version:
```bash
# CUDA 11.X
pip install torch==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu11X
# CUDA 12.X
pip install torch==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu12X 
```
For available CUDA versions, see 
[PyTorch Previous Versions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/).
Once PyTorch is installed, you can install this repository using pip:
```bash
cd geo_neural_op
pip install .
```
If you want to run the example notebooks, you can install the additional dependencies using:
```bash
pip install .[dev]
```
If there is an error installing because of torch-cluster or torch-scatter, adding
the flag `--no-build-isolation` should fix this. Building wheels for torch-cluster and torch-scatter can be quite time consuming.

Alternatively, you can 
install torch-cluster and torch-scatter separately using the pre-built wheels 
corresponding to your PyTorch installation. After they are installed, you can proceed with 
installing this repository. Installing using the pre-built wheels can be done using the appropriate command below:
```bash
# CPU Build
pip install torch_scatter torch_cluster -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.6.0+cpu.html
# CUDA 11.X
pip install torch_scatter torch_cluster -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.6.0+cu121X.html
# CUDA 12.X 
pip install torch_scatter torch_cluster -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.6.0+cu12X.html 
```

__Testing__

You can run tests for the package using

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

__Version 2.0 Efficiency Gains__

``geo_neural_op`` v2.0.0 sees significant efficiency gains by leveraging the
optimized data processing of ``PatchTensor`` and inference of the ``PatchGNP``.
This uses the new separable, block-factorized kernels (see papers). Below, we display a
comparison of the average running times for versions 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 on both CPU
and CUDA devices. Each task is run 10 times on each of the example data sets found
in ``geo_neural_op/example_data``. We display the average times to perform each
task on one data sample from ``example_data``. In all cases, v2.0 sees about >18x
speed up on CPU and about a >7x speed up on CUDA devices. 

| Task | v1.0.0 CPU | v1.0.0 CUDA | v2.0.0 CPU | v2.0.0 CUDA|
|---------------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Geometric Quantities| 139.39s | 22.27s | 7.55s | 2.86s |
| Stiffness Matrix Construction | 2,591.73s | 524.32s | 117.85s | 7.85s |
| Mean Flow (10 steps) | 1,484.20s | 242.42s | 81.61s | 28.10s |
